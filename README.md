# Ray Casting with Spinning Cube

This C++ program demonstrates ray casting with a spinning cube in a 3D space. Ray casting is a fundamental technique used in computer graphics for determining which objects or surfaces are visible to a camera's viewpoint.

## How it works

The program performs ray casting against a rotating cube. It casts rays from a specified origin in a specified direction and checks for intersections with the faces of the spinning cube.

The spinning cube is defined by its vertices and edges, and its rotation is simulated around the y-axis.

## Dependencies

- C++ compiler supporting C++11 standard or higher.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code.
3. Compile the code using your preferred C++ compiler.
4. Run the compiled executable.
5. The program will output whether the cast ray intersects the spinning cube or not.
